.
.SH OPTIONS
.B -l, -ListConfig

The current configuration with all keys and values will be listed. This will give an output like
   ...
   Logging/LogLevel=1
   Network/CoreServerPort=11100
   Network/DemoServerPort=11400
   ...

.TP
.B -s, -SetConfigValue

The value of a configuration property can be changed with this option.
Examples:
  imc -s Logging/LogLevel=4
  imc -SetConfigValue Logging/LogFileDirectory /tmp/italc

.TP
.B -a, -ApplySettings

You can apply the settings previously saved in a settings file using this command.
Examples:
  imc -ApplySettings MyCustomSettings.xml

.TP
.B -i, -ImportPublicKey

You can import a public key file which has been exported during the installation
of the iTALC master computer using this command or its abbreviation.

You can omit the the second parameter which specifies the public key file if it
is located in the directory from which you launch IMC. IMC will automatically
search for a *.key.txt file. If it finds exactly one, it'll import this one.
Examples:
  imc -ImportPublicKey MyPublicKey.key.txt
  imc -i

.TP
.B -CreateKeypair <path>

creates a new key pair for the default role (teacher) with the specified "path" as base dir. If "path" is omitted 
the path is taken from the settings file. This is used in conjunction with role. If role is omitted the default
role is "teacher".

.TP
.B -role [supporter|teacher|admin]

in connection with "CreateKeypair" creates a key pair for the specified role.
