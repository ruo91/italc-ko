.SH NAME
ica \- iTALC Client Application
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ica
.RB "[options]"
.br
.B ica
.RI "[options] [command]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
.B ICA
is the software which needs to run on clients in order to access them using iTALC master application. It provides a VNC server and a service daemon which is neccessary for taking control over the client.

.SH iTALC OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-role\fP \fIrole\fP
.IP
Set role under which ICA should run where \fIrole\fP has to be "teacher", "admin", "supporter" or "other".
.IP "\fB\-port\fP \fIport\fP
.IP
Set port at which the iTALC VNC server should listen. Default: 11100
.PP
The \fB\-createkeypair\fP option has been moved to the iTALC Management Console \fBimc\fP since iTALC 2.0.0.

.SH X11VNC OPTIONS
.IP \fB-noshm\fR
.IP
Do not use the MIT-SHM extension for the polling.
Remote displays can be polled this way: be careful this
can use large amounts of network bandwidth.  This is
also of use if the local machine has a limited number
of shm segments and \fB-onetile\fR is not sufficient.
.PP
\fB-onetile\fR
.IP
Do not use the new copy_tiles() framebuffer mechanism,
just use 1 shm tile for polling.  Limits shm segments
used to 3.
.PP
\fB-nosel\fR
.IP
 Do not manage exchange of X selection/cutbuffer between VNC viewers and the X server at all.
.PP
\fB-nosetclipboard\fR
.IP
Do not set the CLIPBOARD selection for changes received from VNC clients.
.PP
\fB-solid\fR \fI[color]\fR
.IP
To improve performance, when VNC clients are connected try to change the desktop background to a solid color.  The [color] is optional: the
default color is "cyan4".  For a different one specify the X color (rgb.txt name, e.g. "darkblue" or numerical "#RRGGBB").
.IP
Currently  this  option only works on GNOME, KDE3, CDE, XFCE, and classic X (i.e. with the background image on the root window).  The "gconftool-2",
"dcop" and "xfconf-query" external commands are run for GNOME, KDE, and XFCE respectively.
(There  is  no  color selection for XFCE.)  Other desktops won't work, (send us the corresponding commands if you find them).
.IP

.PP
\fB-xrandr\fR \fI[mode]\fR
.IP
If  the display supports the XRANDR (X Resize, Rotate and Reflection) extension, and you expect XRANDR events to occur to the display while
x11vnc is running, this options indicates x11vnc should try to respond to them (as opposed to simply crashing by assuming  the  old  screen
size).  See the xrandr(1) manpage and run Â´xrandr -q' for more info.  [mode] is optional and described below.
.IP
Since  watching for XRANDR events and trapping errors increases polling overhead, only use this option if XRANDR changes are expected.  For
example on a rotatable screen PDA or laptop, or using a XRANDR-aware Desktop where you resize often.  It is  best  to  be  viewing  with  a
vncviewer that supports the NewFBSize encoding, since it knows how to react to screen size changes.  Otherwise, LibVNCServer tries to do so
something reasonable for viewers that cannot do this (portions of the screen may be clipped, unused, etc).
.IP
"mode"  defaults  to  "resize",  which means create a new, resized, framebuffer and hope all viewers can cope with the change.  "newfbsize"
means first disconnect all viewers that do not support the NewFBSize VNC encoding, and then resize the framebuffer.  "exit"  means  disconnect
all viewer clients, and then terminate x11vnc.
