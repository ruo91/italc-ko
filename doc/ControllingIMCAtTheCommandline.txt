Controlling IMC at the commandline
==================================

This document describes how the iTALC Management Console (IMC) can be used
to alter an iTALC installation at the commandline.


Listing current configuration
-----------------------------

The current configuration with all keys and values can be listed via the
"ListConfig" command. It can be abbreviated with "-l".

Example:

   imc -ListConfig


This will give an output like

   ...
   Logging/LogLevel=1
   Network/CoreServerPort=11100
   Network/DemoServerPort=11400
   ...



Changing the value of a configuration property
----------------------------------------------

A the value of configuration property can be changed using the
"SetConfigValue" command. It can be abbreviated with "-s".

Examples:

  imc -SetConfigValue Logging/LogFileDirectory C:\temp
  imc -s Logging/LogLevel=4



Applying settings from settings file
------------------------------------

You can apply the settings previously saved in a settings file using the
"ApplySettings" command. It can be abbreviated with "-a".

Examples:

  imc -ApplySettings MyCustomSettings.xml



Importing a public key
----------------------

You can import a public key file which has been exported during the installation
of the iTALC master computer using the "ImportPublicKey" command. It can be
abbreviated with "-i".

You can omit the the second parameter which specifies the public key file if it
is located in the directory from which you launch IMC. IMC will automatically
search for a *.key.txt file. If it finds exactly one, it'll import this one.

Examples:

  imc -ImportPublicKey MyPublicKey.key.txt
  imc -i
